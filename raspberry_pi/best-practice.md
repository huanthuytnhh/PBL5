# Best Practices for Project Development

This document outlines best practices to follow when contributing to this project. Adhering to these guidelines helps maintain code quality, consistency, and maintainability.

## 1. Code Style

- **PEP 8:** Follow the [PEP 8 Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Use linters like Flake8 or Pylint to help enforce this.
- **Line Length:** Keep lines under 80-100 characters for better readability.
- **Indentation:** Use 4 spaces for indentation. Do not use tabs.
- **Naming Conventions:**
  - `snake_case` for functions, methods, variables, and modules.
  - `PascalCase` (or `CapWords`) for classes.
  - `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
  - Use descriptive names. Avoid single-letter variable names unless their scope is very small and obvious (e.g., loop counters).

## 2. Documentation

- **Docstrings:** Write clear and concise docstrings for all modules, classes, functions, and methods using a standard format (e.g., Google style, NumPy style, reStructuredText). Explain what the code does, its arguments, and what it returns.
- **Comments:** Use inline comments (`#`) to explain complex or non-obvious parts of the code. Avoid redundant comments that just restate the code. Keep comments up-to-date.

## 3. Error Handling

- **Specific Exceptions:** Catch specific exceptions rather than generic `Exception`.
- **Logging:** Use the `logging` module for logging errors, warnings, and informational messages instead of `print()` statements for debugging output that might remain in production code. Configure logging appropriately (e.g., log levels, output destinations).
- **Resource Management:** Use `try...finally` blocks or context managers (`with` statement) to ensure resources (like files or hardware interfaces) are properly released, even if errors occur.

## 4. Version Control (Git)

- **Commit Messages:** Write clear and concise commit messages. Follow conventional commit formats if possible.
- **Branching:** Use feature branches for new development or bug fixes. Keep the `main` branch stable.
- **Pull Requests:** Use pull requests for code review before merging changes into the main branch.

## 5. Dependency Management

- **`requirements.txt` or `setup.py`:** List all project dependencies in `requirements.txt` or within `setup.py`. Specify versions to ensure reproducibility.
- **Virtual Environments:** Use virtual environments (`venv`, `conda`) to isolate project dependencies.

## 6. Configuration

- **Separate Configuration:** Keep configuration values (e.g., API keys, pin numbers, thresholds) separate from the code, perhaps in configuration files (`config.py`, `.ini`, `.yaml`, `.env`). Avoid hardcoding values directly in the source code.

## 77. Raspberry Pi Specific (If Applicable)

- **GPIO Cleanup:** Ensure GPIO pins are cleaned up properly on script exit or interruption to avoid leaving them in unexpected states.
- **Resource Constraints:** Be mindful of the Raspberry Pi's limited resources (CPU, memory). Optimize code where necessary.
- **Permissions:** Be aware of necessary permissions for accessing hardware interfaces (e.g., GPIO, I2C, SPI).

By following these practices, we can build a more robust, understandable, and maintainable project.
