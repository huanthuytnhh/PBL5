# Best Practices for PBL5 Project

## General Guidelines

- **Version Control**: Use Git for version control. Commit changes frequently with clear and descriptive commit messages.
- **Documentation**: Keep the `docs/` folder updated with relevant documentation for each module.
- **Code Quality**: Follow PEP 8 for Python code. Use linters like `flake8` or `pylint` to ensure code quality.
- **Testing**: Write unit tests for all critical functionalities. Place test files in the appropriate `tests.py` files or create separate test scripts.
- **Dependencies**: Maintain all Python dependencies in `requirements.txt`. Use virtual environments to manage dependencies.

## AI Model

- **Data Management**: Organize training data in the `data/` folder. Ensure data is preprocessed before training.
- **Model Training**: Use `train.py` for training models. Save trained models in the `model/` folder with proper versioning.
- **Inference**: Use `inference.py` for running predictions. Ensure the script is optimized for performance.
- **Notebooks**: Keep Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) for experimentation and visualization. Avoid using them for production code.

## Backend

- **Django Framework**: Follow Django best practices for project structure and app development.
- **Database**: Use migrations to manage database schema changes. Avoid making direct changes to the database.
- **API Development**: Keep API logic in `views.py` and use `urls.py` for routing. Follow RESTful principles.
- **Security**: Store sensitive information like API keys in environment variables. Use Django's built-in security features.

## Raspberry Pi

- **Scripts**: Place all scripts in the `raspberry_pi/` folder. Use `main.py` as the entry point for Raspberry Pi operations.
- **Modular Design**: Keep functionality modular by separating logic into different files (e.g., `device_control.py`, `led_control.py`).
- **Testing**: Test hardware components using scripts like `test_led.py` and `test_mic.py`.

## Logs

- **Logging**: Use the `logs/` folder to store logs. Ensure logs are rotated and do not grow indefinitely.
- **Speech Logs**: Keep `speech_log.txt` updated for debugging voice-related functionalities.

## Mobile App

- **Cross-Platform**: Ensure the mobile app is compatible with both Android and iOS.
- **UI/UX**: Follow modern design principles for a user-friendly interface.
- **Integration**: Test the app's integration with the backend and Raspberry Pi.

## ESP32

- **Firmware**: Keep ESP32 firmware updated and compatible with the rest of the system.
- **Communication**: Ensure reliable communication between ESP32 and other components.

## Collaboration

- **Task Management**: Use tools like Trello or Jira to manage tasks and track progress.
- **Code Reviews**: Conduct regular code reviews to maintain code quality and share knowledge.
- **Meetings**: Schedule regular team meetings to discuss progress and resolve issues.

## Deployment

- **Environment**: Use separate environments for development, testing, and production.
- **Automation**: Automate deployment processes using tools like Docker or CI/CD pipelines.
- **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for all critical components to ensure system reliability.
